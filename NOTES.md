This application is a quick reproduction of an existing app written in Meteor. It's not an exact replica of the Meteor app, since the two frameworks (Meteor and React-Native ) are different in many ways. Neither it represents the best of React Native. Itâ€™s just a quick bootstrap of an existing app design and logic. 

* Different frameworks (Meteor and React-Native)
* More or less same logic ( Algorithm = Logic + Control )
* More or less Same design
